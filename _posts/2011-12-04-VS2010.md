title: Taste of Visual Studio 2010 premium
---

Visual Studio 2010 mainly includes these editions:

Comparing professional edition, premium edition has more features on testing and code analysis. Ultimate has more features on design and become more powerful on testing. This suggests testing is more and more important in modern programming. Here are some my feeling about premium edition after few experiences:

## Installation
You don’t need to uninstall professional edition. But once you install premium edition, professional edition will go away. You probably need to reinstall silverlight tools, and reapply visual studio sp1. To avoid being asked to free disk space, you can uninstall visual studio sp1 or professional edition. This is not required.

## Code Coverage
We should ignore this feature. It’s too simple and not worthy of talking about it. NCoverage is much better than it.

## Code Metrics
In solution explorer, right click the solution or project and select “Calculate Code Metrics”. Then Code Metrics Results window is displayed. There are 4 metrics:
* Maintainability index: High values are better. Higher values indicate better maintainability.
* Cyclomatic complexity: Lower values are better. The number of different paths that code can take.
* Depth of inheritance: Lower values are better. The number of class definitions above this one in the inheritance tree, not including interfaces.
* Class coupling: Lower values are better. Number of other entities this entity is dependent on.
* Lines of code: Lower values are better.

These values are measured by IL code. Fore example:
```c#
private void Foo()
{
    List<string> list = new List<string>();
    foreach (var s in list)
    {}
}
```
The class coupling value of this code snippet is 3: List<string>, IEnumerator and IDisposable. We don’t see IEnumerator and IDisposable in source code, but when foreach statement will be “translated” to IL, these two interfaces are called.

I thought that lines of code are also measured by IL code, but it turns out not. But in some case, it seems not being measured by c# code either!

Regarding maintainability index and cyclomatic complexity, I didn’t investigate how Visual Studio calculate.

## Code Analysis
In solution explorer, right click project and select “Run Code Analysis”. Then Error list window is displayed. Visual studio analyzes the project according to specified rule set, then give warning if there is violation.

Every warning has one number and short description, such as CA2214, CA1033. With these numbers, you can find more information on MSDN or other MS forum. These warning won’t result compiling failure, but removing these warning will improve code quality and your programming skills.

In project properties, these is one tab for code analysis. We can select which rule set we’d like to use, and enable running code analysis on build.

## Code definition window
This feature also exists in professional edition. I didn’t know it and just realized it’s useful some time. Opening code definition window, (Ctl+W, D, or click it in view menu), when the mouse point is on a class, then the definition of that class will be shown in the window. We used to press F12 and jump to another window for getting know the class definition, now we have another option.
